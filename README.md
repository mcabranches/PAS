An auto scaling method for cloud computing systems based on containers. For the provision of auto scaling, we used as a metric the response time of web applications, a metric that directly impacts the user's perception. The proposed method used an architecture that integrated Big Data tools, containers orchestrators, control (PID Controllers) and optimization techniques (Coordinate Ascent).
